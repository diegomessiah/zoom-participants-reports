# Zoom Participants Export

A web-app written in Flask which exports the names of participants from a Zoom meeting, given the meeting URL.

The web-app is hosted at: https://orenszoom-report.herokuapp.com/

# Prerequisites

- Make sure to **turn off** the waiting room prior to using the app
- Make sure the meeting is still **in progress**, and is **not** locked

# Instructions

- Visit the [web-app](https://zoom-attendance.herokuapp.com/) using any browser
- Paste the **Meeting Invitation URL** in the text field
- Click on `Export Attendance`

The process could take a couple of minutes. The browser will prompt you to download the attendance as a **CSV** file post the extraction.
